# VtesDecksFront

This project is an Angular application serving as the front-end for [VTES Decks](vtesdecks.com), a online card search, TWD browser and deck builder for Vampire the Eternal Struggle (VTES)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

By default it points to the local backend, you can find how to start the backend at [vtesdecks-back](https://github.com/Zavierazo/vtesdecks-back)

Change `src/environments/environment.ts` to switch apiDomain to `api.vtesdecks.com` and api.baseUrl to `https://api.vtesdecks.com/1.0` to use production api locally.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
