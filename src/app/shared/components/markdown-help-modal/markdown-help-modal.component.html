  <p><strong>VtesDecks</strong> descriptions and comments are written using <strong>Markdown</strong>, a plain-text
    formatting language.
    However, we also
    add in some of our own flavor to allow you to do special things (e.g., adding card, discipline, clans, etc). We also
    removed some of the custom HTML from Markdown to prevent people from
    abusing the design of the site.</p>
  <p>This article will show you some of the basics of creating a markdown text.
    <br>
  </p>
  <h4>Editor Basics</h4>
  <p><strong>Previewing</strong> — While you're editing, you can press the Preview button in the toolbar to
    see what your text will look like after processes all of the Markdown.</p>
  <h4>Formatting Text</h4>
  <p><strong>Headers</strong> — Headers are useful for organizing your content and making the text more organized and
    readable. To create a header, use the number sign (#) followed by your header title. The number of number signs you
    use will dictate the size of the header that is rendered. One being the largest and six being the smallest.</p>
  <p>For example, <code>## This is a header</code> would produce the following:</p>
  <h2>This is a header</h2>
  <p><code>#### This is a smaller header</code> would produce the following:</p>
  <h5>This is a smaller header</h5>
  <br>
  <p>Be sure to include an empty line above and below your header.</p>
  <p><strong>Bold</strong> — In order to bold your text, surround the text with two asterisks (i.e., to make
    <strong>Bold Text</strong> you would type <code>**Bold Text**</code>).
  </p>
  <p><strong>Italic</strong> — In order to italicize your text, surround the text with one underscore (i.e., to make
    <em>Italic Text</em> you would type <code>_Italic Text_</code>).
  </p>
  <p><strong>Strikethrough</strong> — In order to strikethrough your text, surround the text with two tildes (i.e., to
    make <s>Strikethrough Text</s> you would type <code>~~Strikethrough Text~~</code>).</p>
  <h4>Lists</h4>
  <p><strong>Unordered Lists</strong> — Unordered lists are lists that use bullets to start an indented line. To create
    an unordered list, type an dash (-) at the beginning of a line followed by the list item. An example would look like
    this:</p>
  <pre>
  - Unordered List Item 1
  - Unordered List Item 2
  - Unordered List Item 3
  </pre>
  <p>If you wish to create a nested unordered list, you may do so by adding 4 spaces (avoid using tab indentation)
    preceding the list item on subsequent lines. An example would look like this:</p>
  <pre>
  - Unordered List Item 1
  - Unordered List Item 2
      - Indented List Item 1
      - Indented List Item 2
  - Unordered List Item 3
  </pre>
  <p><strong>Ordered Lists</strong> — Ordered lists are lists that use numbers followed by a period to start an indented
    line. The list will begin at whatever number you choose followed by a period. Each subsequent line that begins with
    any number less than 10 digits long followed by a period will create another sequential entry in your ordered list
    regardless of what number you've chosen. To create an ordered list, type a number at the beginning of a line
    followed by a period and a space then the list item. An example would look like this:</p>
  <pre>
  1. Ordered List Item 1
  2. Ordered List Item 2
  3. Ordered List Item 3
  </pre>
  <p>If you wish to create a nested ordered list, you may do so by adding 4 spaces (avoid using tab indentation)
    preceding the list item on subsequent lines. An example would look like this:</p>
  <pre>
  1. Ordered List Item 1
  2. Ordered List Item 2
      1. Indented List Item 1
      2. Indented List Item 2
  3. Ordered List Item 3
  </pre>
  <p>You may also nest ordered lists into unordered lists and vice versa. An example would look like this:</p>
  <pre>
  1. Ordered List Item 1
  2. Ordered List Item 2
      - Indented Unordered List Item 1
          1. Indented Ordered List Item 1
          2. Indented Ordered List Item 2
              - Indented Unordered List Item 1
  3. Ordered List Item 3
  </pre>
  <h4>Embedding Links, Images and Videos</h4>
  <p><strong>Links</strong> — To create a link, surround some text with brackets followed by the URL surrounded with
    parentheses. For example, to create a link to <a href="https://vtesdecks.com">VtesDecks</a> you would type
    <code>[VtesDecks](https://vtesdecks.com)</code>.
  </p>
  <p>You may also add an optional title to a link by enclosing some text in quotation marks after the URL. This will
    result in in a tooltip when the user hovers over the link. Adding to our previous example, the result of
    <code>[VtesDecks](https://vtesdecks.com "A deck building website for Vampire: The Eternal Struggle")</code> would
    look like
    this: <a href="https://vtesdecks.com"
      title="A deck building website for Vampire: The Eternal Struggle">VtesDecks</a>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Images</strong> — To create an image, begin with an exclamation mark (!) followed by some alt text in
    brackets then the URL to the image asset in parentheses. For example,
    <code>![My Favorite GIF](https://media1.giphy.com/media/giphy.gif))</code>
    will result in the
    following:
  </p>
  <p><img
      src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExam56dTdlMTZ1a2J2YmxxcnZ3anVsNGd6MG4wM2lnZTdmaTlncmhrbCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/vQqeT3AYg8S5O/giphy.gif"
      alt="My Favorite GIF"></p>
  <p>If you wish to make an image into a link, enclose the markdown for the image in brackets, and then add the URL in
    parentheses. For example,
    <code>[![VtesDecks](https://vtesdecks.com/assets/img/logo.png)](https://vtesdecks.com)</code>
    will result in the following:
  </p>
  <p><a href="https://vtesdecks.com"><img src="https://vtesdecks.com/assets/img/logo.png" alt="VtesDecks"></a></p>
  <p><strong>YouTube Videos</strong> — To create an embedded YouTube video, surround with double brackets the word
    <code>youtube</code> (all lower case) followed by a colon and then the link ID to the YouTube video you want to
    embed. The link ID can be found after <code>https://youtu.be/</code> in the URL when selecting share from the
    YouTube video or copied from your browser's address bar. For example, the URL
    <code>https://youtu.be/IxX_QHay02M</code> includes the link ID <code>IxX_QHay02M</code>. For example,
    <code>[[youtube:IxX_QHay02M]]</code> will result in the following:
    <iframe width="560" loading="lazy" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IxX_QHay02M" frameborder="0"
      allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""
      style="max-width: 100%;"></iframe>
  </p>
  <h4>Embedding Cards</h4>
  <p><strong>Cards</strong> — Embedding a card will create a link that, when hovered over by the user, will display the
    card. To embed a card, surround the card's name in double brackets. The format is not case sensitive, however, any
    punctuation in the card's name must be present. For example, <code>[[card:British Museum, London, The]]</code> with
    result in the following:
  </p>
  <p><app-markdown-card name="British Museum, London, The" image="/img/cards/102236.jpg"></app-markdown-card></p>
  <h4>Embedding Disciplines</h4>
  <p><strong>Discipline</strong> — Many of Vampire: The Eternal Struggle's disciplines symbols are available for use in
    the
    editor. The format for manually adding the disciplines is surrounding with double brackets the word
    <code>discipline</code> (all
    lower case) followed by a colon and then the discipline abbreviation or name. For example,
    <code>[[discipline:Animalism]]</code> with result in the following:
  </p>
  <p><i class="vtes vtes-small animalism" title="Animalism"></i></p>
  <p>
    The easiest way to add discipline symbols to your text is by using the button on the
    toolbar and then selecting the discipline of your choice.
  </p>
  <h4>Embedding Clans</h4>
  <p><strong>Clan</strong> — Many of Vampire: The Eternal Struggle's clans symbols are available for use in the
    editor. The format for manually adding the clans is surrounding with double brackets the word
    <code>clan</code> (all
    lower case) followed by a colon and then the clan abbreviation or name. For example,
    <code>[[clan:Gangrel]]</code> with result in the following:
  </p>
  <p><i class="vtes vtes-small gangrel" title="Gangrel"></i></p>
  <p>
    The easiest way to add clans symbols to your text is by using the button on the
    toolbar and then selecting the clan of your choice.
