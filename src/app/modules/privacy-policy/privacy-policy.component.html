    The types of tracking technologies we use to automatically collect
    information include:

      Log Files, which are files that record events that occur in connection

    </li>
    <li>
      Cookies, which are small data files stored on your device that act as a

      code). When you access a website, video, email, or advertisement that
      contains a pixel, the pixel may permit us or a separate entity to drop or
      read cookies on your browser. Pixels are used in combination with cookies
      to track activity by a particular browser on a particular device. We may
      incorporate pixels from separate entities that allow us track our
      conversions, bring you advertising both on and off the Sites, and provide
      you with additional functionality.

    how users access and use the Sites. In addition, we work with agencies,

    <i
      >In Short: We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13

    comply with legal requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
    We may offer other options relating to profile visibility. Please visit your

  <h3>Cookies and similar technologies</h3>
  <p>
    Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you
    can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject
    cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could
    affect certain features or services of our Sites. For further information,
    please see our Cookies Policy section.
  </p>
  <h3>Do Not Track</h3>
  <p>
    Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not
    Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no
    industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do with regard
    to these signals. Accordingly, unless and until the law is interpreted to
    require us to do so, we do not monitor or take action with respect to “Do
    Not Track” signals. For more information on “Do Not Track,” visit

  <h3>Analytics and interest-based advertising</h3>
  <p>
    Google provides tools to allow you to opt out of the use of certain
    information collected by Google Analytics at
    https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and by Google Analytics for Display
    Advertising or the Google Display Network at
    https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/.
  </p>
  <p>
    The companies we work with to provide you with targeted ads are required by
    us to give you the choice to opt out of receiving targeted ads. Most of
    these companies are participants of the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”)
    and/or the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). To learn more about the
    targeted ads provided by these companies, and how to opt out of receiving
    certain targeted ads from them, please visit: (i) for targeted ads from DAA
    participants, https://www.aboutads.info/choices; and (ii) for targeted ads
    from NAI participants, https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. Opting
    out only means that the selected participants should no longer deliver
    certain targeted ads to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive
    any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., in connection with the participants’
    other customers or from other technology services).
  </p>
  <p>
    Please note that if you opt out using any of these methods, the opt out will
    only apply to the specific browser or device from which you opt out. We are
    not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any opt out
    options or programs, or the accuracy of any other entities’ statements
    regarding their opt out options or programs.

    the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send or by contacting us as set
    out in the “How Can You Contact Us About This Policy?” section below. You
    will then be removed from the marketing email list – however, we may still
    send you service-related emails that are necessary for the administration
    and use of your account.

  <h2>ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FOR NEVADA RESIDENTS</h2>
  <p>
    Nevada law (NRS 603A.340) requires each business to establish a designated
    request address where Nevada consumers may submit requests directing the
    business not to sell certain kinds of personal information that the business
    has collected or will collect about the consumer. A sale under Nevada law is
    the exchange of personal information for monetary consideration by the
    business to a third party for the third party to license or sell the
    personal information to other third parties. If you are a Nevada consumer
    and wish to submit a request relating to our compliance with Nevada law,
    please contact us as at support&#64;vtesdecks.com.
  </p>
  <h2>ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS</h2>
  <p>
    These additional disclosures apply only to California residents. The
    California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) provides additional rights
    to know, delete and opt-out, and requires businesses collecting or
    disclosing personal information to provide notices and means to exercise
    rights.
  </p>

  <h2>ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FOR DATA SUBJECTS IN EUROPE</h2>
  <h3>Roles</h3>
  <p>
    Data protection laws in Europe distinguish between organizations that
    process personal data for their own purposes (known as “controllers”) and
    organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations
    (known as “processors”). vtesdecks.com acts as a controller with respect to
    personal data collected as you interact with our websites, emails, and
    advertisements.
  </p>
  <h3>Lawful basis for processing</h3>
  <p>
    Data protection laws in Europe require a “lawful basis” for processing
    personal data. Our lawful bases include where: (a) you have given consent to
    the processing for one or more specific purposes, either to us, to our
    service providers; (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a
    contract with you; (c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal
    obligation; or (d) processing is necessary for the purposes of the
    legitimate interests pursued by us or a third party, and your interests and
    fundamental rights and freedoms do not override those interests. Where
    applicable, we will transfer your personal data to third countries subject
    to appropriate or suitable safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses.
  </p>
  <h3>Your data subject rights</h3>
  <p>
    You have the right to access, rectify, or erase any personal data we have
    collected about you. You also have the right to data portability and the
    right to restrict or object to our processing of personal data we have
    collected about you. In addition, you have the right to ask us not to
    process your personal data (or provide it to third parties to process) for
    marketing purposes or purposes materially different than for which it was
    originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. You may withdraw
    your consent at any time for any data processing we do based on consent you
    have provided to us.
  </p>
  <p>
    To exercise any of these rights, please contact us as set out in the “How
    Can You Contact Us About This Policy?” section above and specify which right
    you are seeking to exercise. We will respond to your request within 30 days.
    We may require specific information from you to help us confirm your
    identity and process your request.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please note that we retain personal data as necessary to fulfill the
    purposes for which it was collected, and may continue to retain and use
    personal data even after a data subject request for purposes of our
    legitimate interests, including as necessary to comply with our legal
    obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud, and enforce our agreements.
    When we have no ongoing legitimate interest to process your personal data,
    we will delete, de-identify, or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible
    (for example, because your personal data has been stored in backup
    archives), then we will implement measures to securely store your personal
    data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have any issues with our compliance, you may contact us as set out in
    the “How Can You Contract Us About This Policy” section above. You also have
    the right to lodge a complaint with the data protection regulator in your
    jurisdiction.

    This Cookies Policy explains how Vtes Decks ("vtesdecks", "we", "us", and
    "ours") use cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit
    our websites at https://vtesdecks.com, ("Websites"). It explains what these
    technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our

  <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
  <p>
    Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile
    device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners
    in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well
    as to provide reporting information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cookies set by the website owner are called "first party cookies". Cookies
    set by parties other than the website owner are called "third party
    cookies". Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality
    to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, interactive
    content and analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can
    recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also
    when it visits certain other websites.
  </p>

    also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the

    Websites for advertising, analytics and other purposes. This is described in

  <h2>What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</h2>
  <p>
    Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We
    may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons
    (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny
    graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize
    when someone has visited our Websites. This allows us, for example, to
    monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to
    another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you
    have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a
    third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success
    of e-mail marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are
    reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will
    impair their functioning.
  </p>

  <h2>Do you serve targeted advertising?</h2>
  <p>
    Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve
    advertising through our Websites. These companies may use information about
    your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant
    advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in. They
    may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of
    advertisements. This can be accomplished by them using cookies or web
    beacons to collect information about your visits to this and other sites in
    order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of
    potential interest to you. The information collected through this process
    does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other
    details that directly identify you unless you choose to provide these.
  </p>

  <h2>How can I control cookies?</h2>
  <p>
    You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can
    exercise your cookie preferences by clicking on the appropriate opt-out
    links provided in the cookie table above.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies.
    If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website though your
    access to some functionality and areas of our website may be restricted. As
    the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls
    vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for
    more information.
  </p>

  <h2>How often will you update this Cookies Policy?</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Cookies Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for

    regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookies Policy regularly
